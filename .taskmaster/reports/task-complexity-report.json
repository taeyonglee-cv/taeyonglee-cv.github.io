      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Setup GitHub Pages Repository with Basic Structure",
      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the GitHub Pages repository setup into subtasks covering: 1) Repository creation and GitHub Pages configuration, 2) Directory structure setup with initial files, and 3) GitHub Actions workflow implementation for automated deployment.",
      "reasoning": "This is a relatively straightforward task with well-defined steps. The complexity is low as it involves standard GitHub operations and basic file structure setup. The task is already well-structured but can be organized into logical groupings for better tracking."

      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement i18n Framework with Translation System",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the i18n implementation into subtasks: 1) Create translation file structure and initial content for all languages, 2) Implement language detection and switching mechanism, 3) Develop the core translation function with fallback handling, and 4) Create the UI components for language selection.",
      "reasoning": "This task has moderate complexity as it involves creating a translation system from scratch with multiple languages. It requires both technical implementation (language detection, content replacement) and content creation (translation files). The functionality needs careful testing across different scenarios."
    },

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Personal Info Section",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the personal info section development into: 1) HTML structure and content implementation with i18n integration, 2) Styling for desktop and mobile views, and 3) Implementation of interactive elements like social links and CV download.",
      "reasoning": "This task is moderately complex, requiring frontend development with responsive design considerations. The i18n integration adds some complexity, but the overall structure is straightforward. The task involves HTML, CSS, and some basic JavaScript for interactions."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Create Publication Data Structure and Crawler",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the publication crawler system into: 1) Setup headless browser environment with Puppeteer, 2) Implement Google Scholar data extraction logic, 3) Create data transformation and storage system, 4) Develop caching mechanism with validation, and 5) Configure GitHub Actions for automated daily crawling.",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity as it involves web scraping, which can be brittle and requires robust error handling. It also includes setting up automated processes, data transformation, and caching mechanisms. The crawler needs to handle various edge cases and potential changes to the Google Scholar interface."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Implement LLM-based Abstract Summarization",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the LLM-based summarization system into: 1) Set up LLM API integration and authentication, 2) Develop prompt engineering for effective abstract generation, 3) Implement multi-language summary generation and storage, and 4) Create caching and manual override mechanisms.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves complex integration with external AI services, requiring careful prompt engineering and handling of API responses. The multilingual requirement adds complexity, as does the need for caching to avoid unnecessary API calls. Error handling and fallback mechanisms are critical for reliability."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Build Interactive Publication Table",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the interactive publication table implementation into: 1) Create the basic table structure with responsive design, 2) Implement sorting functionality for different criteria, 3) Develop the collapsible abstract sections with language support, and 4) Add visual elements like citation indicators and thumbnails.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires creating an interactive UI component with multiple features (sorting, collapsing sections) and responsive behavior. The integration with the i18n system and handling of dynamic content adds complexity. The table needs to work across different screen sizes and maintain usability."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Project Section from Structured Files",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the project section development into: 1) Create data structure and sample project files in both JSON and Markdown formats, 2) Implement the loader and parser for project data with i18n support, and 3) Design and implement the card-based layout with responsive behavior.",
      "reasoning": "This task has moderate complexity, involving data parsing from multiple formats and creating a visual display system. The i18n requirements add some complexity, but the overall structure is well-defined. The card-based layout requires careful CSS implementation for responsive behavior."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Responsive Design and Mobile Optimization",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the responsive design implementation into: 1) Define CSS breakpoints and base responsive grid system, 2) Create mobile-specific views for the publication table, 3) Optimize project cards and personal info section for different screen sizes, and 4) Implement touch-friendly UI elements and test across devices.",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity as it requires rethinking the entire UI for different screen sizes. The transformation of the publication table into cards for mobile is particularly complex. Comprehensive testing across multiple devices and screen sizes is necessary to ensure a good user experience."

      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Add SEO and Visitor Tracking",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the SEO and tracking implementation into: 1) Add comprehensive meta tags and Open Graph support with i18n integration, 2) Implement schema.org JSON-LD markup for scholar/person, and 3) Create a lightweight visitor counter with backend integration.",
      "reasoning": "This task has moderate complexity, involving both frontend metadata implementation and a simple backend for visitor tracking. The i18n requirements for meta tags add some complexity. The visitor counter requires setting up a simple API or serverless function, which adds technical breadth to the task."

      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the scroll-based navigation and integration into: 1) Create fixed navigation bar with smooth scrolling functionality, 2) Implement scroll position tracking and active state updates, 3) Add back-to-top button with appearance logic, and 4) Perform final integration and cross-browser testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating interactive navigation that responds to scroll events, requiring careful JavaScript implementation. The integration of all components into a cohesive whole adds complexity, as does the need for cross-browser testing. The animations and transitions need to be subtle and performant."
